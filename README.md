# ruby-mastermind

This project is a console implementation of the mastermind game.

A mastermind game consists in a player that creates a code of 6 colors, then the other player must guess this combination in many turns (12 in this implementation). After a player's turn, the game indicates the player with red pegs if a color is in the correct position and is the correct one; then the white pegs are used when it only guessed correctly a color.
